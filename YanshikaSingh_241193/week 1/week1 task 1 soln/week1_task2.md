# Comparison: OpenCV vs Scikit-Image

## Overview

- **Scikit-learn** serves a general-purpose machine learning role and includes various image feature extraction and processing capabilities.
- It provides a **broader range of algorithms** for image analysis, including **advanced segmentation techniques** and **feature extraction methods**.
- The **choice between OpenCV and Scikit-learn** depends on the **specific requirements** of the application.

## Performance Consideration

- If **real-time performance** is critical, **OpenCV** is the preferred choice.
- If the application requires **advanced image analysis techniques** and **real-time performance is not** a primary concern, **Scikit-learn** (or more specifically, `scikit-image`) may be a better fit.

## Advantages of Scikit-Image  

- **User-friendly** and easier for beginners (source: Google search).
- Focuses on **image processing** (e.g., filtering, segmentation, etc.).
- OpenCV has a **broader focus** on computer vision and image processing.
- **Installation is simpler** than OpenCV (lightweight, fewer dependencies).
- Smaller but active and maintained community.
- Better performance in **noisy and complex images** compared to OpenCV.

## Example: Line Detection using Scikit-Image

```python
from skimage.transform import probabilistic_hough_line
from skimage.feature import canny
from skimage import io, img_as_ubyte
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load image and apply Canny edge detection
image = img_as_ubyte(io.imread('image.jpg', as_gray=True))
edges = canny(image)

# Detect lines using probabilistic Hough transform
lines = probabilistic_hough_line(edges, threshold=10, line_length=5, line_gap=3)

# Visualize the results
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(15, 5))
axes[0].imshow(image, cmap='gray')
axes[0].set_title('Original Image')

axes[1].imshow(edges, cmap='gray')
for line in lines:
    p1, p2 = line
    axes[1].plot((p1[0], p2[0]), (p1[1], p2[1]), 'r-')
axes[1].set_title('Lines Detected with Scikit-image')

plt.show()
