# Alternative Line Detection Method (Beyond Canny + Hough Transform)

## 1. Method Description

### DESCRIPTION OF ALTERNATIVE APPROACH  
Machine learning-based edge detection methods like **Holistically-Nested Edge Detection (HED)**.  
Deep learning methods like HED use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn where edges occur based on labeled training data.

---
 ## Step-by-Step Pipeline
# 1.Preprocessing

Convert the image to grayscale.

Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise (e.g., using SciPy or scikit-image).

# 2.Gradient Computation

Use Sobel filters to compute gradients in X and Y directions.

Calculate the gradient magnitude:
G = sqrt(Gx² + Gy²)
Optionally compute gradient direction:
theta = arctan2(Gy, Gx)

# 3.Thresholding (Edge Point Detection)

Apply a threshold to the gradient magnitude to extract strong edges.

Store coordinates of edge points above the threshold.

# 4.Line Detection with RANSAC

Use RANSAC to robustly fit lines to subsets of edge points.

Each RANSAC iteration tries a random pair of points, fits a line, and counts how many edge points lie close to it (within a distance threshold).

After enough iterations, keep only the best lines based on inlier count.

# 5.Post-processing

Optionally merge similar or overlapping lines.

Visualize detected lines on the original image.

## 💡 Why This Works
Sobel gradients identify high-frequency changes in intensity (edges).

RANSAC is robust to noise and outliers, making it suitable for line fitting in cluttered or noisy edge maps.

Unlike Hough, RANSAC doesn’t require discretization of angle/position space, and can be more flexible with irregular line distributions.

Edit
# Step 1: Preprocessing
image_gray = to_grayscale(image)
image_blur = gaussian_blur(image_gray, sigma=1)

# Step 2: Compute Gradients
Gx = sobel_filter(image_blur, axis='x')
Gy = sobel_filter(image_blur, axis='y')
gradient_mag = sqrt(Gx**2 + Gy**2)

# Step 3: Thresholding
edges = gradient_mag > threshold
edge_coords = np.argwhere(edges)

# Step 4: RANSAC Line Fitting
lines = []
for i in range(max_iterations):
    # Randomly sample 2 points
    p1, p2 = random.sample(edge_coords, 2)
    candidate_line = line_from_points(p1, p2)

    # Count inliers
    inliers = []
    for pt in edge_coords:
        if distance_from_line(pt, candidate_line) < inlier_thresh:
            inliers.append(pt)

    if len(inliers) > inlier_count_thresh:
        lines.append(candidate_line)

# Step 5: Visualization
draw_lines(image, lines)

 ## Assumptions and Parameters

RANSAC iterations: e.g., 1000

Inlier distance threshold: e.g., 2–3 pixels

Inlier count threshold: Minimum inliers to accept a line (e.g., 50 points)

### Summary of How Resources Helped Shape the Approach  
First, I learned what the HED model is. Then I explored CNNs and deep supervised networks.  
I found that CNNs are well-suited for extracting data from grid-like structures, confirming this method’s applicability to line detection.  
Finally, I found research and forum posts that showed HED outperforms traditional methods like Canny edge detection.
