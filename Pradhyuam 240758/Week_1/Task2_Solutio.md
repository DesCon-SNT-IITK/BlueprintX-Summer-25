# Alternative Line Detection Method (Beyond Canny + Hough Transform)

## 1. Method Description

### DESCRIPTION OF ALTERNATIVE APPROACH  
Machine learning-based edge detection methods like **Holistically-Nested Edge Detection (HED)**.  
Deep learning methods like HED use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn where edges occur based on labeled training data.

---

### STEP-BY-STEP BREAKDOWN OF PIPELINE

- **Holistic learning**
- **Nested structure**
- **Deep Supervision**

**Step 1: Input Image**  
You pass an image (e.g., a photo) into a pre-trained CNN (usually based on VGG16).

**Step 2: Side Outputs**  
At different layers of the network (conv2, conv3, conv4, conv5), the model branches out to generate side outputs — preliminary edge maps.  
Each side output captures edges at different scales.

**Step 3: Deep Supervision**  
Each side output is compared with the ground truth edge map using a loss function (typically cross-entropy), and the model is updated accordingly.

**Step 4: Fusion Layer**  
All side outputs are combined (fused) into a final, refined edge map that combines information from all scales.

**Step 5: Final Prediction**  
The output is a binary or grayscale image showing where edges are likely to be.

### WHY THIS METHOD WORKS FOR LINE DETECTION  
Because it uses CNNs, which are primarily designed to extract features from grid-like matrix datasets.  
This is particularly useful for visual datasets such as images or videos, where data patterns play a crucial role.

## 2. Code Sketch

```python
# Read the image
img = cv2.imread("path")

# Create the blob
blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(img, scalefactor=1.0, size=(W, H), swapRB=False, crop=False)

# Load the pre-trained Caffe model
net = cv2.dnn.readNetFromCaffe("path to prototxt file", "path to model weights file")

# Pass the blob of the image to the model and find the output
net.setInput(blob)
hed = net.forward()

# Format the data to display
hed = cv2.resize(hed[0, 0], (W, H))
hed = (255 * hed).astype("uint8")

# Display the output
cv2.imshow("HED", hed)
```

### PARAMETER: `blob`  
A blob is a preprocessed image ready to be fed into a neural network.  
Think of a blob as a 4D array that holds image data in the format that deep learning models expect:  
**Blob shape: (N, C, H, W)** = (batch size, channels, height, width)

### LIBRARIES

### Summary of How Resources Helped Shape the Approach  
First, I learned what the HED model is. Then I explored CNNs and deep supervised networks.  
I found that CNNs are well-suited for extracting data from grid-like structures, confirming this method’s applicability to line detection.  
Finally, I found research and forum posts that showed HED outperforms traditional methods like Canny edge detection.
